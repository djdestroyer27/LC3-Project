# LC3-Project
To run the program load it into an LC-3 simulator and start the execution from the beginning of the program. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the test scores.

Currently, the program does not function correctly. Some issues that need to be addressed:

Program is only able to take the inputs of the first to fourth.

Unable to verify what exactly is wrong and how to properly get it to run correctly

Output isnt displaying the Avg, Min, Max, nor the grade equivalent


Example of how code was supposed to work is represented below.

Input: The user is prompted to enter the test scores one by one.

[Prompt]: 

        "ENTER FIRST SCORE:  "
        "ENTER SECOND SCORE: "
        "ENTER THIRD SCORE:  "
        "ENTER FOURTH SCORE: "
        "ENTER FIFTH SCORE:  "   
        Output Below
          Maximum : 96
          Minimum : 52
          Average : 75
      Grade Equivalence:
      52: F
      87: B
      96: A
      79: C
      61: D
